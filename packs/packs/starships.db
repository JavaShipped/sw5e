This was her fourth sortie of the day, and Sheena was tired. The terrorists just kept coming. Every time she was about to shut her eyes a new wave of the Rebels came. And every time they did, she rushed to her TIE Interceptor and joined the alert fighters to take the fighters down before they could blow a hole in the planet's defenses. Every time they retreated before suffering heavy losses. But every time they came back. This last time she had decided to just nap in the cramped cockpit, so when the claxon rang out, she and her ship were basically ready to fly. This time she was going to end them quickly. As she repeatedly squeezed her trigger, she executed Koiogran turns and snap rolls galore, her laser blasts striking true, and the debris of A-wings, X-wings, and B-Wings--along with some frozen traitor remains--floated in space the next few days. At night, she leaned back against her beau, sipping some wine and watch-ing the beautiful streaks of light cross the sky as, piece by piece, the wreckage burned up in the atmosphere during reentry.</p>\n<p>R5-S1 locked down the loose stabilizer with his gripper arm as he angled the X-Wing's deflector shields.

It was time to go.
